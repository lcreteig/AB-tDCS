These files run the experimental task, adapted for EEG (longer fixation times, sending of event markers/triggers) from the task used by [Georgopoulou & Slagter (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064681) and [London & Slagter (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01679).

1. Open `AB_tDCS-EEG.exp` with [Presentation](https://www.neurobs.com/) (Neurobehavioral systems, Inc.).
2. Run `practice.sce` to start the practice version of the task (20 trials), with task instructions.
3. Run `mainTask.sce` to start the main task. Now set to only 2 blocks of 6 trials; was 5 blocks of 50 trials in the actual study (though no-one actually made it that far; the experimenter stopped the task manually by pressing the "HOME" key after 20 minutes were up).
