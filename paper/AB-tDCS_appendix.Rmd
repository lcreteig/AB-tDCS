(ref:caption-tDCS-AE) __tDCS adverse events__. Number of reports out of 89 sessions (either anodal or cathodal tDCS). Top row shows intensity ratings [_little, moderate, strong, very strong_]; bottom row shows participant's confidence that event was related to tDCS [_unlikely, possibly, likely, very likely_]. Adverse events are sorted in descending order of number of reports (for very rare events (five reports or fewer for a given polarity), some text counts have been removed to prevent overlap).
