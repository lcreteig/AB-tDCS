The sourcedata folder contains the data as originally recored in the Biosemi .bdf format.

Each subject has its own folder with the subject ID ("S01", "S47", etc.). Each folder contains .bdf files using the [SUBJECTID]_[VISITNR][POLARITY]_[BLOCK].bdf naming format, where:

- [SUBJECTID] is the subject ID ("S01", "S47", etc.)
- [VISITNR] is either 1 (first time subject came to the lab), or 2 (second time subject came to the lab)
- [POLARITY] codes for the tDCS polarity they received during this visit (see below).
- [BLOCK] is whether the data were recorded before tDCS ("pre"), during tDCS ("tDCS"), or after tDCS ("post")

When a subject has complete data, each folder should contains 6 files (2 visits, 3 blocks). Some have less because the subject only completed one lab visit. Each file corresponds to one session in the BIDS-compliant data.

Polarity
--------

In the BIDS-compliant data, the polarity is indicated per session, e.g. "ses-anodalpost" contains data from the visit where anodal tDCS was applied, in the block after tDCS.

In the raw data, this was coded to be able to collect data blindly. The coding was changed once, after collecting data for S21.

Anodal is coded as ‘B’ from S01-S21 and ‘D’ from S22 onwards (this is sometimes coded as 'Y' in the EEG preprocessing scripts, to also be able to analyze data blindly).

Cathodal is coded as ‘D’ from S01-S21 and ‘I’ from S22 onwards (this is sometimes coded as 'X' in the EEG preprocessing scripts).
